Hospitality Revenue Insights Dashboard Project
This project details an end-to-end data analytics solution developed for the hospitality domain, mimicking a real-life scenario for a multinational hotel chain.
1. Project Overview
The objective of this project was to generate comprehensive Revenue insights for the management of an imaginary company named Atli Grands, which operates multiple five-star hotels across India. Facing stiff competition, the company required a dashboard to facilitate actionable decision-making.
2. The project followed a standard industry execution flow, including understanding stakeholder requirements (provided by a domain expert/revenue manager), creating mockups and solution design, data gathering and modeling, dashboard construction, and incorporating stakeholder feedback.
3. Key Metrics and Analysis
The final dashboard was designed to provide both high-level Level 1 metrics and detailed Level 2 analyses, allowing managers to identify problems and drill down to find root causes (similar to peeling an onion).

Core Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The dashboard prominently features the following key metrics:
• Revenue
• Occupancy Percentage: Total successful bookings divided by total capacity
• RevPar (Revenue per Available Room): Calculated as Total Revenue divided by Total Rooms Available to Sell, or ADR multiplied by Occupancy
• ADR (Average Daily Rate): The average rate at which rooms were sold
• DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights): The count of available rooms to sell on a daily basis (a key component in RevPar calculation)
• Realization Percentage: Utilized Room Nights (UR) divided by Booked Room Nights (BRN), which shows the percentage of bookings that actually resulted in a customer staying (and generating revenue)

Key Analytical Views
The dashboard incorporates various dimensions and segmentation to facilitate deeper analysis:
1. Performance Trends: Displays weekly or monthly movement below the top key metrics, allowing users to observe week-on-week change and track trends over time using tooltips
2. Weekday vs. Weekend Split: Shows the split of key metrics (Occupancy Percentage, RevPar, ADR, Realization Percentage) between weekdays (Sunday to Thursday) and weekends (Friday and Saturday, which are peak days in the hotel industry). This is critical for Level 2 analysis, particularly pricing strategy evaluations
3. Channel/Platform Level Analysis: Facilitates Level 2 analysis by breaking down metrics (like ADR and realization) across various booking platforms (channels)
4. Property Level Detail: A granular table view lists all properties, showing metrics like Revenue, RevPar, Occupancy Percentage, and Average Rating, enabling identification of the lowest and highest performing hotels
5. Interactive Filtering: Includes dynamic filters (slicers) for City, Room Type (e.g., Allied, Premium), Month/Year, and Week Number to narrow down insights
